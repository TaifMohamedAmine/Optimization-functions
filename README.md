package That contains optimization functions that allows the user to minimize a function of n arguments or solve a system using different methods 

this deposit might contain some french commentary it is advised to translate the commentary of a function before using it

this projet is a python package that contains implementations of scipy-like functions that help minimize functions(convexe) or solve linear systems with different methods
